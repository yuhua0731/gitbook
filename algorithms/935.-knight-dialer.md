# 935. Knight Dialer

The chess knight has a **unique movement**, it may move two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically (with both forming the shape of an **L**). The possible movements of chess knight are shown in this diagaram:

A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:

We have a chess knight and a phone pad as shown below, the knight **can only stand on a numeric cell** (i.e. blue cell).

Given an integer `n`, return how many distinct phone numbers of length `n` we can dial.

You are allowed to place the knight **on any numeric cell** initially and then you should perform `n - 1` jumps to dial a number of length `n`. All jumps should be **valid** knight jumps.

As the answer may be very large, **return the answer modulo** `10 ** 9 + 7`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 1
</strong><strong>Output: 10
</strong><strong>Explanation: We need to dial a number of length 1, so placing the knight over any numeric cell of the 10 cells is sufficient.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 2
</strong><strong>Output: 20
</strong><strong>Explanation: All the valid number we can dial are [04, 06, 16, 18, 27, 29, 34, 38, 40, 43, 49, 60, 61, 67, 72, 76, 81, 83, 92, 94]
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 3131
</strong><strong>Output: 136006598
</strong><strong>Explanation: Please take care of the mod.
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 5000`

```python
def knightDialer(self, n: int) -> int:
    dir = [[1, 2], [1, -2], [-1, 2], [-1, -2], [2, 1], [2, -1], [-2, 1], [-2, -1]]
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    def valid(x, y):
        if x < 0 or x > 3 or y < 0 or y > 2: return False
        if x == 3 and y != 1: return False
        return True

    dp = [[1] * 3 for _ in range(4)]
    dp[3][0] = dp[3][2] = 0
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        nxt = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(4)]
        for i, j in product(range(4), range(3)):
            for x, y in dir:
                if valid(i + x, j + y):
                    nxt[i + x][j + y] += dp[i][j]
        dp = [[j % MOD for j in i] for i in nxt] 
    return sum([sum(i) for i in dp]) % MOD
