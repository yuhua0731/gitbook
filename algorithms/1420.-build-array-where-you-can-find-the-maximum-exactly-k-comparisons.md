# 1420. Build Array Where You Can Find The Maximum Exactly K Comparisons

[1420. Build Array Where You Can Find The Maximum Exactly K Comparisons](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-array-where-you-can-find-the-maximum-exactly-k-comparisons/)

```python
class Solution:
    def numOfArrays(self, n: int, m: int, k: int) -> int:
        # dp
        # dp[A][c][b] represents for the number of ways that 
        # totally A numbers are present
        # current maximum number is b and has exactly c comparisons till now
        
        # we can downsize the dp array to 2d, since dp[A] only depends on dp[A - 1]
        # nxt[c][b] = dp[c - 1][1] + dp[c - 1][2] + ... dp[c - 1][b - 1] + dp[c][b] * b
        # 1 bug found: this sum should not take 'dp[c][i] where i > b' into account, since we need to keep the maximum number presented
        # 2 bug found: 
        #   when you are going to append a new number without change the maximum number presented, you can choose any number between [1, b]
        #   when you are going to append a new number and change the maximum number presented, you can only choose the maximum number b
        # thus
        # nxt[c][b - 1] = dp[c - 1][1] + dp[c - 1][2] + ... dp[c - 1][b - 2] + dp[c][b - 1] * (b - 1)
        # nxt[c][b]     = dp[c - 1][1] + dp[c - 1][2] + ... dp[c - 1][b - 2] + dp[c - 1][b - 1] + dp[c][b] * b
        # in one loop of b, we don't need to recalculate all element, we can use prefix sum to speed up
        # simplyfy: nxt[c][b] = nxt[c][b - 1] - dp[c][b - 1] * (b - 1) + dp[c - 1][b - 1] + dp[c][b] * b
        #                         â†‘ pre_sum

        MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
        dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
        # initialization
        # total 1 number present, exactly 1 comparison
        for i in range(1, m + 1): dp[1][i] = 1
        for _ in range(1, n):
            nxt = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
            for c in range(1, k + 1):
                for b in range(1, m + 1):
                    nxt[c][b] = (nxt[c][b - 1] - dp[c][b - 1] * (b - 1) + dp[c - 1][b - 1] + dp[c][b] * b) % MOD
            dp = nxt
        return sum(dp[k]) % MOD
```

* `time complexity: O(nmk)`
* `space complexity: O(mk)`
