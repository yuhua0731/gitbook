# 2251. Number of Flowers in Full Bloom

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `flowers`, where `flowers[i] = [starti, endi]` means the `ith` flower will be in **full bloom** from `starti` to `endi` (**inclusive**). You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `people` of size `n`, where `people[i]` is the time that the `ith` person will arrive to see the flowers.

Return _an integer array_ `answer` _of size_ `n`_, where_ `answer[i]` _is the **number** of flowers that are in full bloom when the_ `ith` _person arrives._

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: flowers = [[1,6],[3,7],[9,12],[4,13]], poeple = [2,3,7,11]
</strong><strong>Output: [1,2,2,2]
</strong><strong>Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
</strong>For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/02/ex2new.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: flowers = [[1,10],[3,3]], poeple = [3,3,2]
</strong><strong>Output: [2,2,1]
</strong><strong>Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
</strong>For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.
</code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= flowers.length <= 5 * (10 ** 4)`
* `flowers[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= starti <= endi <= 10 ** 9`
* `1 <= people.length <= 5 * (10 ** 4)`
* `1 <= people[i] <= 10 ** 9`

```python
def fullBloomFlowers(self, flowers: List[List[int]], people: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # heapq
    # we maintain a heap that stores the flowers that are blooming
    # for each arrived person, we pop all flowers that has a start day <= person's arrival day
    # then we push the popped flowers back to the heap, and pop all the flowers that has an end day < person's arrival day
    heapq.heapify(flowers)
    blooming = []

    n = len(people)
    ret = [-1] * n
    # sort people by arrival day
    people = sorted(enumerate(people), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for idx, day in people:
        while flowers and flowers[0][0] <= day:
            heapq.heappush(blooming, heapq.heappop(flowers)[1])
        while blooming and blooming[0] < day:
            heapq.heappop(blooming)
        ret[idx] = len(blooming)
    return ret
```
